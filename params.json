This was inspired by [BounceExchange](http://bounceexchange.com/).\r\n\r\n\r\n### The philosophy behind this project\r\nThis library helps you increase your landing page conversion rates. From my experience, you can expect a lift of 7% to 15% depending on your audience, traffic type (paid or unpaid) and offer.\r\n\r\nTalking about offers... __please__ use OuiBounce to __provide value__ to your visitors. With tools like these __it's very easy to create something spammy-looking__ that provides little value to prospective customers yet ensures a terrible experience.\r\n\r\nNot sure what I mean by \"provide value\"? Here are a few ideas to get your creative juices flowing:\r\n\r\n- Free ebook\r\n- Upcoming webinar invite\r\n- Exclusive access to XYZ\r\n- [A full educational course](http://do.thelandingpagecourse.com/)\r\n- [Valuable content](https://training.kalzumeus.com/)\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nDownload the [minified](build/ouibounce.min.js) or [unminified](build/ouibounce.js) script and include it on your page. OuiBounce is wrapped by a [umd wrapper](https://github.com/ForbesLindesay/umd), so if you are using _requirejs/amd_ or _commonjs/browserify_, it will still work fine.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\nTo use it simply:\r\n\r\n- Create a hidden modal\r\n- Select the modal with vanilla JavaScript (or jQuery) and call ouibounce. Here's an example:\r\n\r\nWithout jQuery    \r\n```js\r\nouiBounce(document.getElementById('ouibounce-modal'));\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing jQuery    \r\n```js \r\nouiBounce($('#ouibounce-modal')[0]);\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### Options\r\nOuiBounce offers a few options, such as:\r\n\r\n- Sensitivity\r\n- Aggressive mode\r\n- Timer\r\n- Callback\r\n\r\n__Configuring sensitivity:__ Use it to define how far your mouse has to be from the window breakpoint. The higher value the more sensitive. _Defaults to 20._\r\n\r\nExample    \r\n```js\r\nouiBounce(document.getElementById('ouibounce-modal'), { sensitivity: 40 });\r\n```\r\n\r\n__Enabling aggressive mode:__ By default, OuiBounce will only fire once. When OuiBounce fires a cookie is created to ensure an _non obtrusive_ experience. There are cases, however, when you may want to be more aggressive (as in, you want the modal to be elegible to fire anytime the page is loaded). A perfect example is Paid landing pages.\r\n\r\nHere's how to enable aggressive mode:    \r\n```js\r\nouiBounce(document.getElementById('ouibounce-modal'), { aggressive: true }});\r\n```\r\n\r\n__Set a min time before OuiBounce fires:__ By default, OuiBounce won't fire in the first second. You can pass a timer option like so:\r\n```js\r\nouiBounce(document.getElementById('ouibounce-modal'), { timer: 0 }});\r\n```\r\n\r\n__Set callback:__ You can also add a callback which will fire once OuiBounce has been triggered:\r\n```js\r\nouiBounce(document.getElementById('ouibounce-modal'), { callback: function() { console.log('fired !'); } });\r\n```\r\n\r\n__Multiple options:__ You can also combine multiple options. Here's an example\r\n```js\r\nouiBounce(document.getElementById('ouibounce-modal'), {\r\n  aggressive: true,\r\n  timer: 0,\r\n  callback: function() { console.log('ouiBounce fired!'); }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n[Live example](http://colors.carlsednaoui.com/)\r\n\r\n### Miscellaneous\r\n- This library provides no guarantees.\r\n- To contribute, check out [contributing.md](contributing.md).\r\n- Licensed under [MIT](license.md).\r\n- Special thanks to [Zertosh](https://github.com/zertosh), [Jenius](https://github.com/jenius) and [BounceExchange](http://bounceexchange.com/).\r\n\r\n<!-- Grab your social icons from https://github.com/carlsednaoui/gitsocial -->\r\n[1]: http://i.imgur.com/tXSoThF.png (twitter)\r\n[1.1]: http://www.twitter.com/carlsednaoui\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
