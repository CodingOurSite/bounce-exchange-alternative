This was inspired by [BounceExchange](http://bounceexchange.com/).\r\n\r\n\r\n### The philosophy behind this project\r\nThis library helps you increase landing page conversion rates. From my experience, you can expect a lift of 7% to 15% depending on your audience, traffic type (paid or unpaid) and copy.\r\n\r\nTalking about copy... __please__ use OuiBounce to __provide value__ to your visitors. With tools like these __it's very easy to create something spammy-looking__.\r\n\r\nNot sure what I mean by _provide value_? Here are a few ideas to get your creative juices flowing:\r\n\r\n- Free ebook\r\n- Upcoming webinar invite\r\n- Exclusive access to XYZ\r\n- [A full educational course](http://do.thelandingpagecourse.com/)\r\n- [Valuable content](https://training.kalzumeus.com/)\r\n\r\n## Demo / Example\r\n- [Example #1](http://carlsednaoui.github.io/bounce-exchange-alternative/)\r\n- [Example #2](http://colors.carlsednaoui.com/)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nYou can also read the docs as a [GitHub Page](http://carlsednaoui.github.io/bounce-exchange-alternative/).\r\n\r\nDownload the [minified](build/ouibounce.min.js) or [unminified](build/ouibounce.js) script and include it on your page. OuiBounce is wrapped by a [umd wrapper](https://github.com/ForbesLindesay/umd), so if you are using _requirejs/amd_ or _commonjs/browserify_, it will still work fine.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n1. Create a hidden modal\r\n1. Select the modal with vanilla JavaScript (or jQuery) and call ouibounce\r\n\r\nHere's an example:\r\n\r\nWithout using jQuery    \r\n```js\r\nouiBounce(document.getElementById('ouibounce-modal'));\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing jQuery    \r\n```js \r\nouiBounce($('#ouibounce-modal')[0]);\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### Options\r\nOuiBounce offers a few options, such as:\r\n\r\n- Sensitivity\r\n- Aggressive mode\r\n- Timer\r\n- Callback\r\n\r\n__Sensitivity:__ Define how far the mouse has to be from the window breakpoint. The higher value, the more sensitive. _Defaults to 20._\r\n\r\nExample    \r\n```js\r\nouiBounce(document.getElementById('ouibounce-modal'), { sensitivity: 40 });\r\n```\r\n\r\n__Aggressive mode:__ By default, OuiBounce will only fire once for each visitor. When OuiBounce fires, a cookie is created to ensure a _non obtrusive_ experience.\r\n\r\nThere are cases, however, when you may want to be more aggressive (as in, you want the modal to be elegible to fire anytime the page is loaded/ reloaded). An example use-case would be on your Paid landing pages.\r\n\r\nHere's how to enable aggressive mode:    \r\n```js\r\nouiBounce(document.getElementById('ouibounce-modal'), { aggressive: true });\r\n```\r\n\r\n__Set a min time before OuiBounce fires:__ By default, OuiBounce won't fire in the first second. You can pass a timer option like so:\r\n```js\r\nouiBounce(document.getElementById('ouibounce-modal'), { timer: 0 });\r\n```\r\n\r\n__Callback:__ You can add a callback, which will run once OuiBounce has been triggered:\r\n```js\r\nouiBounce(document.getElementById('ouibounce-modal'), { callback: function() { console.log('OuiBounce fired!'); } });\r\n```\r\n\r\n__Multiple options:__ You can also combine multiple options:\r\n```js\r\nouiBounce(document.getElementById('ouibounce-modal'), {\r\n  aggressive: true,\r\n  timer: 0,\r\n  callback: function() { console.log('ouiBounce fired!'); }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Miscellaneous\r\n- This library provides no guarantees.\r\n- To contribute, check out [contributing.md](contributing.md).\r\n- Licensed under [MIT](license.md).\r\n- Special thanks to [Zertosh](https://github.com/zertosh), [Jenius](https://github.com/jenius) and [BounceExchange](http://bounceexchange.com/).\r\n\r\n<!-- Grab your social icons from https://github.com/carlsednaoui/gitsocial -->\r\n[1]: http://i.imgur.com/tXSoThF.png (twitter)\r\n[1.1]: http://www.twitter.com/carlsednaoui\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
